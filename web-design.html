    <h1>WEB DESIGN</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Web design refers to the process of creating the visual appearance and layout of a website. It involves making design decisions about the color scheme, typography, graphics, and overall aesthetic of the site. Web designers use various tools and software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Sketch, to create mockups and prototypes of the website's design.</li>

        <li>Web design also includes creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate through the website easily. Designers consider factors such as information architecture, visual hierarchy, and usability to ensure that the website is visually appealing and functional.</li>
        
        <li>Web design is closely related to user experience (UX) design, as both disciplines aim to create websites that are visually pleasing and provide a positive user experience. However, web design primarily focuses on the visual aspects of a website, while UX design takes into account the overall user journey and interaction with the site.</li></ul>
