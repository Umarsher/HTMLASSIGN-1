    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses a variety of tasks, including web design, coding, programming, and database management. Web development involves using various programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, to build functional and interactive websites. It also involves optimizing websites for performance, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and incorporating security measures to protect user data. Web developers may work on the front-end, which focuses on the user interface and user experience, or on the back-end, which deals with the server-side programming and database management.</p>
